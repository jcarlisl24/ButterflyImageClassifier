# ButterflyImageClassifier
In this project, we implement a convolutional neural network which classifies images of butterflies by species. Our data set consists of 6499 images of size 224 x 224, each of which depicts a butterfly of one of 75 possible species. We achieve an accuracy of about 83% on our testing set.
